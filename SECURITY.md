- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Implement rate limiting
- Log security events

### Security Testing

We encourage security testing but please follow these guidelines:

- Social engineering attacks
- DoS/DDoS attacks
- Data destruction or corruption
- Accessing other users' data

### Security Updates

When security vulnerabilities are found:
